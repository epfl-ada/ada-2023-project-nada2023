# Welcome to Our Analysis of the CMU Movie Dataset

Over half of the global film revenues are realized internationally, beyond the confines of the movies originating nations. In a world where movies not only entertain but also influence and connect cultures, understanding the factors that drive international success is more crucial than ever. What makes a movie resonate beyond its home turf? Let's explore.

## Introduction

Welcome to our detailed exploration of the fascinating world of movies. In this project, we dive deep into the CMU Movie Dataset, combined with IMdB's box office data ([**BoxOfficeMojo.com**](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/)) unraveling the intricate factors that contribute to the international success of films. Our journey through this dataset is not just about numbers and charts; it's a story about how movies transcend borders and cultural barriers to captivate audiences worldwide.

We examine various elements such as genre preferences, box office trends, and the impact of production countries on a movie's global appeal. By combining statistical analysis with insightful visualizations, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of what makes a movie resonate internationally.

Join us as we uncover the hidden narratives behind the data and reveal the evolving landscape of the film industry in an increasingly interconnected world.


## Evolution Across Time

 We observed a nuanced shift in the patterns of international success of movies over the years. By integrating box office data with release dates, we could effectively trace the trajectory of international appeal. Our analysis revealed a gradual increase in the international market share of movies, especially in the latter half of the 20th century and early 21st century.

</div>

We can clearly observe a trend since the start of the 21st century of the ratio of the box office done internationally. Multiple factors could explain this observation : 
- Due to gloablisation, over the past few decades the investments in publicity abroad has drastically increased, and due to new technologies it is much easier to reach a wider audience
- Thanks to internet, it is much easier to gather data on international box office now than before, so we might have more accurate distribution of the box office per country


Our following network graph illuminates the flow of movie exports across continents, with a spotlight on the USA and Europe as key players. These regions dominate both in producing and exporting films, particularly to each other, underscoring their significant roles in the global film industry. This visualization captures the essence of their cinematic exchange and the wider reach of their movies worldwide, reflecting the universal appeal and cross-cultural impact of cinema.

## Influence of the genre

 The first factor we studied was the influence of the genre on the international success of movies. We looked at the proportion of the box office done outside of the production countries, and the total box office, for each genre. We also looked at the evolution of the proportion of the box office done outside of the production countries for each genre across time.
 
First, in order to get an idea of how many genres there are per movie, here is a histogram representing the distribution of the number of genres across movies:

 

 <div class="responsive-iframe">
    <iframe src="plots/nb_genres.html"></iframe>
</div>

Most movies have multiple genres, and the most common number of genres is 3. We can also see that there are a lot of movies with only one genre, and a few movies with 7 or more genres.

Now let us look at which genres export the most, as well as the recent evolution of the most exported genres :

<div class="responsive-iframe">
    <iframe src="plots/most_international_genres.html"></iframe>
</div>

<div class="responsive-iframe">
    <iframe src="plots/genre_evolution.html"></iframe>
</div>

As we see from above, science-fiction and thriller genres emerge as the most exported movie categories. This popularity can be attributed to their wide appeal, cutting-edge special effects, and often universal themes that resonate across different cultures. On the other hand, the World cinema and Documentary genres appear to be the least exported. This could be due to their niche appeal and the fact that documentaries and World cinema movies often delve into culturally specific subjects, which might not translate as effectively to international audiences. 

Now, let's explore the genres that dominate exports from each continent and identify which genres are most popular among viewers in these regions.

    <iframe src="plots/pie_chart_exported.html"></iframe>
</div>

<div class="responsive-iframe">
    <iframe src="plots/pie_chart_watched.html"></iframe>
</div>

As we delve into these charts, we can see some interesting patterns emerge. For instance, Asia stands out with its exceptionally diverse genre distribution in movie exports. This variety likely arises from the region's wide range of film styles, including the vivid storytelling of Bollywood, the creative flair of Japanese anime, and the engaging narratives of Chinese cinema, all contributing to Asia's unique presence in the international film market.

## Influence of Co-Productions

In this part we will analyse how the co-production of a movie across different countries influences it's success. First, let's take a look at all coproductions world-wide. 

<div class="responsive-iframe">
    <iframe src="plots/country_co-productions.html"></iframe>
</div>

This interactive map shows us that alot of countries are involved in coproductions. We clearly see that the USA, the UK, France and Germany are involved in most of them. By zooming in we can also see how european countries are involved in alot of coproductions. 

Let's now take a look at the evolution of the proportion of coproduced films across time. 

<div class="responsive-iframe">
    <iframe src="plots/movies_coprod_ratio.html"></iframe>
</div>


The prevalence of co-produced movies is rising, yet compared to the overall surge in film production, their proportion remains consistent. Analysis of recent trends reveals a marginal uptick in multi-country collaborations over the past two decades, hinting that co-productions may modestly enhance a movie's revenue. This raises key questions: What is the optimal number of countries for maximizing revenue, and how many should collaborate to maximize revenue generated outside the production countries?

<div class="responsive-iframe">
    <iframe src="plots/mean_revenue_coprod_number.html"></iframe>
</div>

So on average movies made in two countries are the ones yielding the most revenues. The use of T-test allowed us to see that the difference in mean was statistically significant, which allows us to conclude that the collaboration of two countries should lead on average to a higher grossing film than any other number of co-production coutries. Even if the test allows us to say that the difference is statistically different the T-statistic is rather small (~2), this tells us that although a difference exists it has a moderated impact.


### Coproduction countries vs. ratio of international revenue

We now know that the best number of countries for total gross is usually 2, is this the same if we look at the ratio of the revenue made outside of the production countries? I'll let you pause for a minute and think about how increasing the number of co-production countries might affect the international ratio.

![mmmh!](plots/thinking_meme.jpg)

The following graphs are two representation of the same idea. The first on is a line plot of the Mean ratio of the revenue made by movies made in a given number of coutries. The second one is the same values but plotted as a box plot to give a more accurate idea about the distribution of the values. 

<div class="responsive-iframe">
    <iframe src="plots/mean_ratio_coprod.html"></iframe>
</div>
<div class="responsive-iframe">
    <iframe src="plots/ratio_int_box_coprod.html"></iframe>
</div>

Here we can see that the more co-production countries we have, the more the ratio of the revenue is made in foreign coutries. This result might be a little counter-intuitive. If we had defined a _main production country_ and we had looked at the ratio of the revenue made outside of this country it would have seemed obvious that it would be higher, because part of the revenue would have bean made in  the _secondary production country_. Here we look at the ratio of the box office made outside of all the production countries and we still have a positive correlation. As before the use of T-test allows us to be sure that the difference is statistically. Moreover, this time the T-statistic is much higher (for 1 country vs. multiple T-stat ~ -19). With the same reasoning as before we can now look at how different genres behave regarding the number of co-producing countries. We did various T-test to see which countries augmented their export by co-producing movies. With a T-statistique of around -13 the USA is the one country from the few we analyzed that gains the most when co-producing with other countries. France and India also gain a bit but the difference is much lower both have a T-statistic of ~3. 

<div class="responsive-iframe">
    <iframe src="plots/ratio_int_coprod_genre.html"></iframe>
</div>

In this case almost all genre seem to follow the expected trend with small variations. The only notable exception to the rule is the _Thriller_ genre that has a ratio of international revenue that goes down when we reach 4 co-production countries. 

### Influence of the number of regions 

We made a small analysis about the number of region that produced a movie and its relation to the ratio of international revenue. We found very similar results as for the number of co-production countries. We can explain that by the fact that 75% of the co-produced movies have countries from multiple regions. We can make the simplified hypothesis that adding a country is like adding a region so we won't repeat ourselves.    

## Influence of the number of languages

Since we analysed the influence of the number of co-production countries had in the revenue and the export of the movies. We wondered if having multiple languages could also help export movies. Since the two ideas are pretty simlar, we will follow the same template as for the number of coproduction countries. 

<div class="responsive-iframe">
    <iframe src="plots/movies_lang_ratio.html"></iframe>
</div>

This graph is really similar to the one about the ratio of movies made by more than one country. Our anaylsis stays the same if we see an augmentation it is probably due to multiple factors, one of them being that it should help boost the revenue of the movies. As before we ask ourself how many language should a movie have to have the best expected revenue? And is this the same number if we want our movie to export as much as possible?

<div class="responsive-iframe">
    <iframe src="plots/gross_languages.html"></iframe>
</div>

In the graph above we only kept movies that have up to five languages because our dataset doesn't contain enough movies with more infomation to be relevant in our study. This visualisation shows us that the more languages, or at least up to five languages, you have, the more on average your movie is suppose to make. Since we don't have enough information about movies with more languages we cannot say what the perfect number of languages would be, but we can say that the more the better although you probably don't want to overdo it. The T-test here is much clearer with a T-statistic of ~ -8, as usual the p/value is reallz small and allows us to say that the difference is statistically relevent. As for the co-production countries let us do the same analysis but seperate the result per genre. 

<div class="responsive-iframe">
    <iframe src="plots/mean_rev_lang_genre.html"></iframe>
</div>

We can see that most genres follow the expected trend with the notable exceptions being Adventure, Thriller and Crime Fiction. The Adventure movies mysteriously don't perform as well when they have 3 and five languages but others follow the expected trend. Thriller and Crime Fiction take a hit at 4 languages and then go back up at five. For all three of these anomalies we weren't able to give an explanation. But even with these particularities we would still advise a movie do have as many languages as possible (or at least up to five).

### Number of languages vs. ratio of international revenue

We now know that the higher the number of languages the higher the total gross is, can we say the same if we look at the ratio of the revenue made outside of the production countries. Just as before we'll let you pause and try to predict how the following graph might look like.

<img src = "plots/Drake_meme.png" class="center">


We used the same representation as before. Two graphes showing the average export ratio of the movies one as a line plot one as a box plot. 

<div class="responsive-iframe">
    <iframe src="plots/mean_ratio_lang.html"></iframe>
</div>

<div class="responsive-iframe">
    <iframe src="plots/ratio_int_box_lang.html"></iframe>
</div>

This time the ratio of international revenue behaves the same as the total revenue, i.e. the more languages you have the more you can expect your movie to export. As before the use of T-test allows us to be sure that the difference is statistically significant. Moreover, this time the T-statistic is much higher (for 1 language vs. multiple T-stat ~ -14). With the same reasoning as before we can now look at how different genres behave regarding the number of languages. We did various T-tests to see which language benifited in their export by mixing them with others movies. With a T-statistique of around -13 English is the one language from the few we analyzed that gains the most when mixing with others. French and Japanese also gain a bit but the difference is much lower both have a T-statistic of ~ -3. For Spanish and Hindi, which complete the top 5 of most common languages in our dataset, the difference is not statistically significant

<div class="responsive-iframe">
    <iframe src="plots/mean_rev_lang_genre.html"></iframe>
</div>

Except for minor exceptions the genres behave as we would except them to. Meaning that, at least up to 5 languages, the more languages the better. The science-fiction is the only genre that doesn't reach its maximum with 5 languages. 
 

## Influence of Diversity

When investigating if dicersity impacted the performance in a movie, we looked at 3 different factors : 
- The gender ratio and representation of the actors
- The ethnicity of the actors
- The number of languages spoken in the movies

### Gender Representation

We analysed the proportion and number of both male and female actors, as well as cast sizes, and looked for links with the performance, internationally and globally:
![Revenue per number of actors per gender](notebook_files/notebook_54_0.png)
<div class="responsive-iframe">
    <iframe src="plots/gross_per_female_ratio.html"></iframe>
</div>
<div class="responsive-iframe">
    <iframe src="plots/ratio_export_per_female.html"></iframe>
</div>

We observe that although there is a negative correlation between the ratio of female actors to the total number of actors and the revenue (spearman correlation of -0.14, P Value extremely close to 0), the international share of the gross does not seem significantly impacted (spearman correlation of -0.04, P Value extremely close to 0 once again). 

### Ethnic Diversity

Another factor taken into account is whether the number of represented ethnicities in a movie would have an impact. After retrieving the ethnicities of the actors we had access to in the CMU Dataset, we calculated the entropy of the ethnicity of the actors. For a given number of represented ethnies, the entropy is maximal when each ethnies appear with equal proportion. We then looked at the correlation between this entropy and the international share of the gross.
<div class="responsive-iframe">
    <iframe src="plots/ethnic_entropy"></iframe>
</div>

As we can see the entropy of the ethnies is positively correlated with the international share of the gross, meaning that the more diverse the cast is, the more likely the movie is to be successful internationally. However, this is also biased towards larger casts as the entropy is higher for larger casts.
