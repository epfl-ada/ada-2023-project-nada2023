## Introduction

Welcome to our detailed exploration of the fascinating world of movies. In this project, we dive deep into the CMU Movie Dataset, unraveling the intricate factors that contribute to the international success of films. Our journey through this dataset is not just about numbers and charts; it's a story about how movies transcend borders and cultural barriers to captivate audiences worldwide.

We examine various elements such as genre preferences, box office trends, and the impact of production countries on a movie's global appeal. By combining statistical analysis with insightful visualizations, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of what makes a movie resonate internationally.

Join us as we uncover the hidden narratives behind the data and reveal the evolving landscape of the film industry in an increasingly interconnected world.


## Evolution Across Time

 We observed a nuanced shift in the patterns of international success of movies over the years. By integrating box office data with release dates, we could effectively trace the trajectory of international appeal. Our analysis revealed a gradual increase in the international market share of movies, especially in the latter half of the 20th century and early 21st century.
